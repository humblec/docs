## Overview

A Clone is defined as a duplicate of an existing Kubernetes Volume.  For more information on cloning in Kubernetes see the concepts doc for [Volume Cloning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#volume-cloning).  A storage provider that allows volume cloning as a create feature, may choose to implement volume cloning via a control-plan CSI RPC call.

For details regarding the kuberentes API for volume cloning, please see [kubernetes concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-pvc-datasource/).

## Implementing Volume cloning functionality

To implement volume cloning the CSI driver MUST:

1. Implement checks for `csi.CreateVolumeRequest.VolumeContentSource` in the plugin's `CreateVolume` function implementation.
2. Implement `CLONE_VOLUME` controller capability.

It is the responsibility of the storage plugin to either implement an expansion after clone if a provision request size is greater than the source, or allow the external-resizer to handle it.  In the case that the plugin does not support resize capability and it does not have the capability to create a clone that is greater in size than the specified source volume, then the provision request should result in a failure.

## Deploying volume clone functionality

The Kubernetes CSI development team maintains the [external-provisioner](external-provisioner.md) which is responsible for detecting requests for a PVC DataSource and providing that information to the plugin via the `csi.CreateVolumeRequest`.  It's up to the plugin to check the `csi.CreateVolumeRequest` for a `VolumeContentSource` entry in the CreateVolumeRequest object.

There are no additional side-cars or add on components required.

## Enabling Cloning for CSI volumes in Kubernetes

Volume cloning was promoted to Beta in version 1.16 and GA in 1.18, and as such is enabled by defult for kubernetes versions >= 1.16

In Kubernetes 1.15 this feature was alpha status and required enabling the appropriate feature gate:

```shell
--feature-gates=VolumePVCDataSource=true
```

## Example implementation

A trivial example implementation can be found in the [csi-hostpath plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-host-path) in its implementation of `CreateVolume`.
